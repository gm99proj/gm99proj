Hey everyone, welcome to the GM Proj Rep!

If you're curious about me: I'm a passionate engineer fascinated by the manufacturing sector. 
As a professional, I am learning and view it as a never-ending journey that helps me thrive and strive for mastery.
Some of my key interests lie in subtractive and additive manufacturing, laser jet cutting, water/abrasive jet cutting, wire EDM, and robot-assisted manufacturing, among others. 
Additionally, I'm particularly intrigued by exploring technology collaborations such as AI and ML.

Here, you'll find projects undertaken in the aforementioned sectors. It's just the beginning, and I'm excited to see this platform grow with more projects and innovations.

Feel free to suggest any changes or provide feedback—it's always appreciated!
